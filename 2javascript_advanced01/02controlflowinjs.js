//************************************** CONTROL FLOW IN JS *************************************************************************************************************
// Control flow in JavaScript is a fundamental concept that dictates the order in which code is executed. 

// Control Flow:
// 1. Sequential Execution: By default, JavaScript executes code line by line from top to bottom.
// 2. Decision-Making (Conditionals): if, else if, and else, switch statements, Loops, While Loops, 
// Do-While Loops, For..of Loops, For..in Loops: Execute code blocks based on a condition.
