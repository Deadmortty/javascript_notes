// *********************** API Requests and V8 Engine **********************************************************************************************************************
// What is an API?
// API stands for Application Programming Interface.
// Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant. The waiter (API) takes your order (request), delivers it to the kitchen (server/system), 
// and then brings the food (response) back to you.

// In technical terms:
// An API acts as a bridge that allows two systems (like your app and a server) to talk to each other without 
// exposing their internal details.
// Example: When you use an app to check the weather, your app sends a request to a weather API, 
// which gives back the weather data as a response.


// Key parts of an API:
// 1. Request:
// Made by the client (your app/browser).
// Specifies the data you want or the action you want to perform.
// Example: "Give me the current weather for New York."

// 2. Endpoint:
// The specific URL where the API is available.
// Example: https://api.weather.com/current?city=NewYork.

// 3. Response:
// The data sent back by the API.
// Usually in JSON format (JavaScript Object Notation)—a structured format that’s easy to read and work with in JavaScript.
